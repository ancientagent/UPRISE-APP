- Provides status messages

**Usage:**
```powershell
.\start-all.ps1
```

### 4. `stop-services.ps1`
Stops all services and frees up ports.
- Automatically finds and kills processes on ports 3000 and 8081

   ```

2. **Stop everything when done:**
   ```powershell
   .\stop-services.ps1
   ```

3. **Start services individually:**
   ```powershell
   .\start-backend.ps1    # In one terminal
   .\start-metro.ps1      # In another terminal
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you get "port already in use" errors:
1. Run `.\stop-services.ps1` to free up ports
2. Then run `.\start-all.ps1` again

If scripts don't run:
1. Make sure PowerShell execution policy allows scripts:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
